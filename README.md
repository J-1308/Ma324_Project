EV Charging Network Simulation & Optimisation (MA324 Project – LSE)

📘 Overview

This project models and simulates the operations of an electric vehicle (EV) charging network to identify optimal infrastructure configurations under uncertain demand conditions.
Developed as part of MA324: Mathematical Modelling & Simulation at the London School of Economics, the study combines operations research, queueing theory, and discrete-event simulation to analyse system performance and customer behaviour.

Objectives

	•	Design a data-driven simulation of EV charger utilisation and customer flow.
	•	Model driver arrivals, charging times, and abandonment behaviour using stochastic processes (Poisson and exponential distributions).
	•	Compare system efficiency under varying mixes of fast and slow chargers.
	•	Minimise average wait times, lost demand, and improve charger utilisation through optimisation.

⸻

Key Features

	•	Nonhomogeneous Poisson arrivals to represent fluctuating demand over time.
	•	Customer patience model incorporating probabilistic abandonment thresholds.
	•	Dual-queue design (fast vs slow chargers) simulated using event scheduling.
	•	Performance metrics: average waiting time, sojourn time, abandonment rate, utilisation.
	•	Optimisation layer using AMPL to evaluate design trade-offs and system improvements.

⸻

Tools & Technologies

	•	R – for discrete-event simulation, data analysis, and visualisation.
	•	AMPL / CPLEX – for optimisation modelling and scenario testing.
	•	Mathematical Techniques: queueing theory, stochastic modelling, nonlinear optimisation.
